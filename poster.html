					<b class="paragraph" ="paragraph">Depression is a common disorder that affects one's mood and their ability to perform everyday activities. Through a chemical imbalance in the brain, one will feel thoughts of doubt, guilt and worthlessness for a period of at least two weeks. <br> <br>

					Despite the serious nature of the disorder, there is hope and many treatment options. One of the most common modes of treatment is through psychotherapy and talking to a trained specialist. Another way to treatment could be through medication that one would take daily to fight it.</b>

					<b class="paragraph">Anxiety is another common disorder in the country that affects over 40 million Americans. It is closely associated with depression and about half of people diagnosed with anxiety will be diagnosed with depression as well. The biggest problem with anxiety is that over two-thirds of people who suffer with it do not get help. <br> <br>

					There are many different forms of anxiety and each one comes with a different set of symptoms. The common theme throughout each one is excessive worry that interferes with daily life. It is natural for someone to feel nervous during important events, but when it prohibits one from living a normal life is when one should seek help. </b>
